# Java Programming: An Introduction to Software Specialization
## Learn the basics of programming and software development with Java
### Created by The Duke University

This Specialization covers the fundamentals of software development, focusing on a beginner-level introduction to rigorous problem-solving approaches while still embracing and extending traditional methods of computer science and software engineering. You’ll explore foundational concepts such as algorithm development, data representation, and debugging, using common tools such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Java. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills you learned by creating a working recommender system that can help users find and choose items, such as films, books, or restaurants. Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses.
